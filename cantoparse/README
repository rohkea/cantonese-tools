A dead-simple program that appends definitions and transcription to Chinese
(Cantonese) words.

The program itself is written in C, but to re-generate the wordlist youâ€™ll need
Chicken Scheme.


WARNING! No wordlist is included in this version!

Generate your own from CantoFish, Cantonese CC-EDICT or (for Mandarin)
CC-EDICT data!


My wordlist uses CantoFish Cantonese dictionary, derived from CC-EDICT and
therefore distributed under CC-BY-SA. If you wish, you can use a different
dictionary (to get Mandarin readings, you can use the CC-CEDICT).

All the dictionary data is stored in file.

Program reads stdin and outputs stdout. If you need something else, use
input/output redirection.

The output format is likely to be changed in future versions. Use with care.
